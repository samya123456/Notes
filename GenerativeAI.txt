1) what is embedding
2) How chatGPT supports local languages although there is so low data set to train a model. -->
First, ChatGPT uses its language-processing features to identify the language youâ€™ve used in your question/prompt. 
It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the intent and emotion behind the text.
3) Difference between GPT 3.5 vs 4.
4) Top Generative AI models :
  i) ChatGPT 
  ii) Bert 
  iii) DAll E
5) Type of prompting
  i) Zero shot prompting: The model is expected to generate a response even though it hasn't been explicitly trained on the particular prompt.
      This capability is a strength of large pre-trained language models like GPT-3.5, which can generalize from the broad range of data they were trained on to understand and respond to new prompts or tasks.
  ii) A few shots prompting: "A few-shot prompting" typically refers to a scenario where a language model is given a few examples or instances of a specific task or question, along with the corresponding desired responses, to help guide its understanding and performance on that task
  iii) chain of thought prompting: Instead of providing a single prompt, you supply a series of prompts where each subsequent prompt builds on the information or context from the previous one
  iv) Self Consistency prompting: "Self-consistency prompting" involves prompting a language model to generate responses that are internally consistent or coherent. This approach aims to guide the model to provide answers that align with information or context established within the same prompt or conversation.
