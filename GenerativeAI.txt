1) what is embedding
2) How chatGPT supports local languages although there is so low data set to train a model. -->
First, ChatGPT uses its language-processing features to identify the language you’ve used in your question/prompt. 
It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the intent and emotion behind the text.
3) Difference between GPT 3.5 vs 4.
4) Top Generative AI models :
============================
  i) ChatGPT 
  ii) Bert 
  iii) DAll E
5) Type of prompting:
======================
  i) Zero-shot prompting: The model is expected to generate a response even though it hasn't been explicitly trained on the particular prompt.
      This capability is a strength of large pre-trained language models like GPT-3.5, which can generalize from the broad range of data they were trained on to understand and respond to new prompts or tasks.
  ii) A few shots prompting: "A few-shot prompting" typically refers to a scenario where a language model is given a few examples or instances of a specific task or question, 
along with the corresponding desired responses, to help guide its understanding and performance on that task
  iii) chain of thought prompting: Instead of providing a single prompt, 
you supply a series of prompts where each subsequent prompt builds on the information or context from the previous one
  iv) Self-Consistency prompting: "Self-consistency prompting" involves prompting a language model to generate responses that are internally consistent or coherent. 
This approach aims to guide the model to provide answers that align with information or context established within the same prompt or conversation.
6) Generative Adversarial Network: ********
=================================
The primary idea behind GANs is to train two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, in a competitive framework.
Here's a brief overview of how GANs work:
  i) Generator:
  The generator takes random noise as input and generates data (e.g., images, text) that ideally is indistinguishable from real data.
  ii) Discriminator:
  The discriminator is a separate neural network that evaluates whether a given piece of data is real (from the actual dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).
  iii)Training Process:
  The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator aims to produce data that is realistic enough to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to become better at distinguishing real from fake data.
  iv)Adversarial Process:
  The generator and discriminator form a kind of adversarial partnership. As the generator gets better at generating realistic data, the discriminator adjusts to become more discerning, and vice versa.
  v)Equilibrium:
  Ideally, this adversarial process reaches equilibrium when the generator produces data that is indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator is unable to differentiate between the two.

7) What is generative AI, and how does it differ from other AI approaches?
generative models’ ability to create new data rather than just analyzing or categorizing existing data.

8) How do you evaluate the quality of generated content from generative AI ?

i) Inception Score: 
The Inception Score is a metric used to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated images,
particularly in the context of generative adversarial networks (GANs).
ii) Frechet Inception Distance (FID),
iii) Perceptual Path Length (PPL).
