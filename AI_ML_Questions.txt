1) Machine Learning: Automated Analytical model
2) Neural Network: A Type of machine learning Architecture modeled after biological neurons.
3) Deep Learning: A Neural Network with more than one hidden layer.

4) Overfitting:
doWhen your Model touches every single point of your training data , your error is really low in the training set. but it doesn't create a good prediction model as it doesn't fall under any matematical equation y = f(x) . that's why we get error large in validation set or in test set. this is called Overfitting i.e fitting too much to the noise data.

5) Good Model should look like having large error at the begining and error will reduce over over training ovar period of time.
6) Epochs: 1 echochs is running the entire training data 1 time through your model.

Model Evaluation matrix:
  i) Accuracy = number of currect prediction / total number of predictions.
  ii) Recall = number of true positive / (number of true positive + number of false negative)
  iii) Precision = number of true positive / (number of true positive + number of false positive)
  iv) f1 Score = combination of Recall and Precision  matrix = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)

True positive : the pic is of the Dog and the model predicted it as Dog.
True Negative : the pic is not of the Dog and the model predicted it's not a Dog.
False positive : the pic is not of the Dog and the model predicted it's a Dog.
False Negative : the pic is of the Dog and the model predicted it's not a Dog.

Confusion Matrix :  We can Organise our predicted values compare to the real values in the Cofusion matrix
