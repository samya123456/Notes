1) Machine Learning: Automated Analytical model
2) Neural Network: A Type of machine learning Architecture modeled after biological neurons.
3) Deep Learning: A Neural Network with more than one hidden layer.

4) Overfitting:
when your Model touches every single point of your training data, your error is really low in the training set. but it doesn't create a good prediction model as it doesn't fall under any mathematical equation y = f(x). that's why we get an error large in the validation set or in the test set. this is called Overfitting i.e. fitting too much to the noise data.

5) Good Model should look like having large errors at the beginning and errors will reduce over training a period of time.
6) Epochs: 1 epoch is running the entire training data 1 time through your model.

Model Evaluation Matrix: Classification Problem
================================================
  i) Accuracy = number of correct predictions / total number of predictions.
  ii) Recall = number of true positive / (number of true positive + number of false negative)
  iii) Precision = number of true positive / (number of true positive + number of false positive)
  iv) f1 Score = combination of Recall and Precision  matrix = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)

True positive: the pic is of the Dog and the model predicted it as Dog.
True Negative: the pic is not of the Dog and the model predicted it's not a Dog.
False positive: the pic is not of the Dog and the model predicted it's a Dog.
False Negative: the pic is of the Dog and the model predicted it's not a Dog.

Confusion Matrix:  We can Organise our predicted values compare to the real values in the Cofusion matrix

Model Evaluation Matrix: Regression Problem
===============================================
A linear Regression Problem is when your model is continuously predicting the result of a problem

 i) Mean Square Error
 ii) Mean Square Error
 iii) Root Mean Square Error


Unsupervised Learning
====================
Dealing with unlabeled data.

Tasks in unsupervised Learning:
==============================
i) Clustering - Grouping together unlabeled data points into clusters based on similarity
ii) Anomaly Detection - Attempt to detect outliers (Exceptions) in the dataset
iii) dimensionality reduction


Difference between supervised learning and Unsupervised learning stages: Only one difference is that we don't split the dataset into Train and Test datasets in Unsupervised learning as the data is unlabeled.
